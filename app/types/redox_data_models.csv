        Basic Science: One or more interventions for examining the basic mechanism of action (for example, physiology or biomechanics of an intervention).
        Device Feasibility: An intervention of a device product is being evaluated in a small clinical trial (generally fewer than 10 participants) to determine the feasibility of the product; or a clinical trial to test a prototype device for feasibility and not health outcomes. Such studies are conducted to confirm the design and operating specifications of a device before beginning a full clinical trial.

Research,Study,Study,Study.Design.Phase,Object,2,false,"N/A: Trials without phases (for example, studies of devices or behavioral interventions).
        Early Phase 1 (Formerly listed as ""Phase 0""): Exploratory trials, involving very limited human exposure, with no therapeutic or diagnostic intent (e.g., screening studies, microdose studies). See FDA guidance on exploratory IND studies for more information.
        Phase 1: Includes initial studies to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of drugs in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and to gain early evidence of effectiveness; may include healthy participants and/or patients.
        Phase 1/Phase 2: Trials that are a combination of phases 1 and 2.
        Phase 2: Includes controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in participants with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks.
        Phase 2/Phase 3: Trials that are a combination of phases 2 and 3.
        Phase 3: Includes trials conducted after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather additional information to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug.
        Phase 4: Studies of FDA-approved drugs to delineate additional information including the drug's risks, benefits, and optimal use.","For studies of drug products, the numerical phase of the study."
